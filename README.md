# Cryptographic-Algorithm

This  is  the  document  contains  the  detailed  description  of  the  individual 
project “Development of Cryptographic Algorithm” developed for converting 
the  plain text into cipher text and vice versa.  In addition, the major  purpose 
of  the  cryptographic  algorithm  is  not  just  conversion  of  plain  text  but 
provides the working mechanism of the cryptographic algorithm. This report 
primarily  consists  of many distinct  chapters  start from introduction, history, 
different types of  algorithms, and many more.  This report highlights  older 
versions of algorithms  have many flaws which can be easily compromised 
by the attacker. While compromising data of organization, all the  important 
data of organization got damaged. To overcome these types of flaws, we 
have  done  much  research  related  to  cryptographic  algorithms  and  have 
modified the less secure algorithms. In simple word, this report highlights 
the  importance  of  secure  cryptographic  algorithm  in  an  organization  for 
securing their data’s.
